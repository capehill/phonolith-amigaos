Tiny Manual

Every channel of the mixer unit listens to the MDI channel with the same number. Select a MIDI input in the settings window (menu "Program/Settings..."), or use the default "phonolith.thru".
Press a number button to open an instrument editor window (hold SHIFT while clicking to open instrument in an extra window). Press "Add" to add AIFF/WAVE sound files for this instrument. Every sound can be put on a key and/or velocity range. The "base key" is the key, on which the sound will be played with its original frequency.
Press the "On" button in the mixer window to activate the MIDI receiver and audio output. Send MIDI to Phonolith from a keyboard or a sequencer (e.g. Horny)...
To save a song as AIFF file, activate the "Mixdown" button and select an output file. If the player is not active, then switch it on. Recording will start, when the first MIDI event arrives Phonolith. To stop it, deactivate "Mixdown" or switch off the player.
